============

Learning Meteor and Blade.

# Setup

You need [Meteorite](http://oortcloud.github.com/meteorite/) installed, and then:

```
git clone https://github.com/juanpastas/fresh-fishes
cd fresh-fishes
mrt
```

`mrt` should be in your path, I created a link for it in one of the directories in my `PATH`:

```
ln -s /usr/local/share/npm/bin/mrt /usr/local/bin/mrt
```
